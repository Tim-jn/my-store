# My Store

## Description

Your job is to build an e-commerce website â€“ an application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Project features

This application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* <b>Product list</b> page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* <b>Product details</b> page, which displays more information about any particular product
* <b>Shopping cart</b>, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* <b>Checkout form</b>, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* <b>Order confirmation</b> page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install the dependencies with `npm run install`.

3. Run `ng start` for a dev server. 

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
